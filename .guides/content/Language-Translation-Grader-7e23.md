# Language Translation Grader

The language translation grader allows you to create a Parsons Puzzle using pseudocode. Unlike a line-based grader, language translation asks you to translate each line of pseudocode into Python. The student code is then evaluated and compared to an expected value. Students need to arrange the code blocks (distractors can be used).
