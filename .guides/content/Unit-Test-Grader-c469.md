# Unit Test Grader

The unit test grader uses a unit test to evaluate student code. Students need to arrange the code blocks in the correct order (including indentation). Codio then calls a unit test on the student solution, and checks the student code against an expected value. You can have multiple test cases with a specific error message for each test case.
