# Variable Check Grader

This type of Parsons Puzzle does not grade the lines of the code. Instead it checks the final value of variables after the code blocks are executed. Click on the values in the dotted red or black boxes to toggle the values for each variable. Make sure the code blocks are in the correct order and have correct indentation before submitting.
