# Turtle Grader

The turtle grader has blocks of Turtle Graphics code. The code can be in Python or a pseudocode (you **must** translate the pseudocode into Python for evaluation). You can provide code for an animated demo so students understand what their turtle needs to do. Students can click on the animation to watch it again. Codio will also evaluate student code with Turtle Graphics output so they can compare to the animated demo.
